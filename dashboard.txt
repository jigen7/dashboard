## Build an Olympics results dashboard

The goal of this challenge is to build a PHP API which can be used to display results and upcoming events from the next Olympics.

The API should support a JavaScript application to:

 - Display events which are coming up.
 - View the sports that are currently in progress.
 - Displays results from the previous games/races under the current sports.

Eg. Basketball -> USA are currently playing Australia, 1hr ago Brazil defeated China 89-76, 2hrs ago Russia defeated Japan 102-101. Next game is USA vs Spain in 4 hours.

Bonus points: Build a JavaScript application which calls the API which displays results and upcoming events.
